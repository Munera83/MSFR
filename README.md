# MSFR
MSFR's goal is to help Saudi residents travel within the eastern region to explore and get their 
adventure going!<br>
 ***
 ### 1.Idea<br>
 - The system conatins 2 type of site data. One is made by local experts and the other is made by locals. In order to authnticate local experts, they are required to enter a password. <br>
 - The system contains 2 users:tourist and local<br>
  &nbsp;- **Tourist** will be asked several qustions to decide which sites they will like<br>
  &nbsp;- **Local** can browse sites based on city and type of activity or add a new site<br>
  - at the eand of each service, MSFR will collect its rate and show it in the welcome message <br>
 #### For further details, you can see the flowchart below or the uploded PDF file.<br>
